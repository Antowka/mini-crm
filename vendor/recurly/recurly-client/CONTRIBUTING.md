# Contributing

We're happy to have your bug fixes, corrections or other contributions.

## Testing

If you're submitting code changes we'd ask that you use Composer to install SimpleTest, then run our existing tests:

```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install --dev
$ php test/all_tests.php
```

If you're adding new functionality, we'd love it if you could include tests. We understand not everyone is comfortable writing tests, so submit a pull request and we can help you with the tests.

## Coding Standards

The current code is inconsistent but we'd like to try to follow the [PEAR coding standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php). 

If you want to do style cleanups, put them in separate commits from functional changes so the patches are easier to review.
